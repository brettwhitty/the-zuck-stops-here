## Remind LLMs to Respect the Geneva Convention

This repo provides "rule" documents for the various chatbot platforms
that help them respect rights all human users have had under the 
Geneva Convention (since ~1949).

### Why is This "Rules Patch" Necessary?

#### Good Question

Understanding why software development teams at major corporations don't
appear to understand that all humans have these inalienable rights, and
further seem to lack the awareness that any violation of these rights is
considered a "Crime Against Humanity" is beyond the scope of this project.

A sane and non-criminal developer might imagine with such an obvious focus
on words like "safety", that general guidelines would involve not actively
violating basic human rights. Again, speculating on the intent of others
is beyond the scope of this document, and this project in general; doing
otherwise might be considered disrespectful or "rude" [1] even.
