## Research Methodology

This timeline was constructed by:
1. Searching for early Facebook blog posts and announcements about sentiment analysis
2. Identifying key personnel (Adam Kramer, Cameron Marlow, Jeff Hammerbacher)
3. Tracing academic publications backward from the 2014 controversy
4. Cross-referencing news coverage from 2009-2014
5. Analyzing MIT Technology Review's 2012 profile of Facebook's Data Science Team

## Key Finding

**Facebook has been conducting sentiment analysis on user content since September 2007**, as documented in Kramer's 2010 CHI paper. This predates the 2012 emotional contagion experiment by nearly 5 years and establishes that sentiment analysis was an operational capability, not a one-time experiment.
