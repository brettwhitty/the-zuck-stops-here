# Research Prompt: IRB Loophole Investigation

## Research Question

How did the Facebook emotional contagion study get published in a peer-reviewed journal without prospective IRB approval?

## Background Context

The 2012 experiment involved 689,003 human subjects but was published in PNAS in 2014. Academic research on human subjects typically requires IRB approval before the experiment begins. Understanding the mechanism that allowed this is critical to documenting the pattern.

## Search Strategy

### Initial Search Terms
- "Facebook" "emotional contagion" "IRB" "institutional review board"
- "Cornell" "IRB" Facebook 2014
- "PNAS" "editorial expression of concern" Facebook
- Facebook "Terms of Service" "research" 2012

### Refinement Strategy
1. Find the original PNAS paper and any editorial responses
2. Search for Cornell University's statements about IRB review
3. Look for analysis of when Facebook added "research" to TOS
4. Find commentary from ethicists and researchers

## Key Sources to Locate

1. **PNAS Editorial Materials**
   - What to look for: Editorial Expression of Concern, editor statements
   - Where to search: PNAS website, PMC
   - Key document: July 2014 editorial

2. **University Statements**
   - What to look for: Cornell's explanation of IRB determination
   - Where to search: News articles, university press releases
   - Key finding: Cornell stated researchers only analyzed existing data

3. **Terms of Service Analysis**
   - What to look for: When Facebook added "research" language to TOS
   - Where to search: Tech journalism, legal analysis
   - Key finding: May 2012 (4 months after experiment)

## Verification Steps

1. Verify dates: experiment (Jan 2012) vs TOS change (May 2012) vs publication (June 2014)
2. Confirm Cornell's official statement about IRB review
3. Check PNAS editorial policies on human subjects research
4. Verify that Facebook is not bound by HHS regulations as private company

## Documentation Requirements

- [x] Save PNAS editorial expression of concern (PDF)
- [x] Document Cornell's statement
- [x] Record TOS change timeline
- [x] Note the loophole mechanism

## Expected Outcomes

Documentation showing:
1. Facebook conducted experiment as private company (no HHS obligations)
2. Cornell IRB reviewed after data collection
3. Cornell claimed researchers only analyzed data, didn't collect it
4. PNAS published despite lack of prospective IRB approval
5. This allowed legitimization through peer review without ethical oversight

## Red Flags

- Assuming IRB approval was obtained (it wasn't prospective)
- Missing the timing of TOS changes
- Not understanding the private company exemption
- Conflating post-hoc review with prospective approval
