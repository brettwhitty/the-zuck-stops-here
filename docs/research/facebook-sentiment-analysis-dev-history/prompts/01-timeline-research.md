# Research Prompt: Facebook Sentiment Analysis Timeline

## Research Question

When did Facebook first deploy sentiment analysis on user-generated content, and what is the documented history of this capability?

## Background Context

The 2014 publication of Facebook's emotional contagion study revealed that Facebook had manipulated 689,003 users' News Feeds in 2012. The research question is: was this a one-time experiment, or evidence of an ongoing operational capability?

## Search Strategy

### Initial Search Terms
- "Facebook" "sentiment analysis" "2007" OR "2008" OR "2009"
- "Adam Kramer" Facebook "gross national happiness"
- "Facebook Data Science Team" "Cameron Marlow"
- "Facebook" "emotional" "analysis" timeline history

### Refinement Strategy
1. Start with public announcements (blog posts, press releases)
2. Trace backward from 2014 study to find earlier mentions
3. Identify key personnel and search for their publications
4. Look for academic papers citing Facebook data

## Key Sources to Locate

1. **Academic Papers**
   - What to look for: Papers by Adam Kramer, Cameron Marlow analyzing Facebook emotional data
   - Where to search: ACM Digital Library, PNAS, Google Scholar
   - Date range: 2007-2014
   - Key paper: Kramer 2010 CHI paper on emotional expression

2. **News Articles and Blog Posts**
   - What to look for: Facebook announcements about "Gross National Happiness" or mood tracking
   - Where to search: Tech news sites, Facebook engineering blog, archived blog posts
   - Date range: 2009-2012
   - Key finding: October 2009 public announcement

3. **Technical Profiles**
   - What to look for: Profiles of Facebook's Data Science Team
   - Where to search: MIT Technology Review, tech journalism
   - Key article: "What Facebook Knows" (June 2012)

## Verification Steps

1. Cross-reference dates across multiple sources
2. Verify author affiliations (Facebook employment)
3. Check if papers reference data collection periods
4. Confirm publication dates vs. data collection dates
5. Look for primary sources (Facebook's own announcements) vs. secondary reporting

## Documentation Requirements

- [x] Save all source URLs
- [x] Download PDFs of academic papers
- [x] Record search dates
- [x] Note access restrictions (paywalls, Cloudflare protection)
- [x] Document search refinements
- [x] Create BibTeX bibliography

## Expected Outcomes

Timeline showing:
- September 2007: Data collection begins (per Kramer 2010 paper)
- 2009: Gross National Happiness project initiated
- October 2009: Public announcement
- 2010: Academic publication documenting the capability
- January 2012: Emotional contagion experiment
- June 2014: Study publication

## Red Flags

- Sources that only discuss the 2014 controversy without historical context
- Conflating sentiment analysis capability with the specific 2012 experiment
- Missing the distinction between operational capability and published research
- Relying solely on post-2014 commentary without primary sources
