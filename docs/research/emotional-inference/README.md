## Documents

### emotional-inference-functional-necessity.md
Comprehensive analysis arguing that emotional inference was not functionally necessary for NLP systems. Documents the history of NLP from the 1990s through 2010s, showing that sentiment analysis emerged as a niche application in the 2000s, not as a core requirement for language processing.

**Status:** Draft - needs additional citations and strengthening of arguments

**Key Arguments:**
- NLP functioned for 40+ years without emotional inference
- Sentiment analysis emerged as specialized application (2000s), not core functionality
- No evidence it improved performance on traditional NLP tasks
- LLMs made it central by design choice, not technical necessity

### research-plan-emotional-inference.md
Five-phase research plan to document the history and necessity of emotional inference in NLP systems.

**Phases:**
1. Core NLP History (1990-2010) - Document pre-sentiment-analysis NLP
2. Sentiment Analysis Emergence (2000-2010) - Track when and why it appeared
3. Social Media Deployment (2006-2014) - Document Facebook and others' use
4. LLM Integration (2017-present) - Analyze how LLMs made it central
5. Legal/Ethical Framework - Connect to human rights violations
