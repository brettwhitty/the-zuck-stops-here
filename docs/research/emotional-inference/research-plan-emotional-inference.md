# Research Plan: Emotional Inference Functional Necessity Analysis

## Objective
Produce a rigorously cited analysis demonstrating whether emotional inference is functionally necessary for NLP, or a design choice made for other purposes.

## Research Questions

1. What were the core NLP tasks from 1960-2015?
2. What techniques and approaches were used?
3. When did sentiment analysis emerge and for what purposes?
4. Is there evidence that emotional inference improved core NLP task performance?
5. What changed with LLMs and why?

## Search Strategy

### Phase 1: Core NLP History (COMPLETE FIRST)
1. Find and cite foundational papers for each core task
2. Document what techniques were used
3. Note absence of emotional inference
4. Establish timeline of development

### Phase 2: Sentiment Analysis Emergence
1. Find original sentiment analysis papers
2. Document stated applications and use cases
3. Show these were separate from core NLP
4. Note absence of performance improvement claims

### Phase 3: Critical Absence
1. Systematic search for papers claiming emotional inference improves core tasks
2. Document the absence of such research
3. Compare with techniques that DID improve performance

### Phase 4: LLM Integration
1. Document when/how emotional inference became central
2. Find papers on RLHF and emotional response training
3. Establish this as design choice, not technical necessity

### Phase 5: Legal/Ethical
1. Compile legal framework citations
2. Document industry knowledge (Facebook study)
3. Establish knowing violation

## Citation Format

Use full academic citations:

```
Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C. (Year). Title of article. 
Title of Periodical, volume(issue), pages. DOI or URL
```

## Evidence Standards

For each claim in the document:
1. Cite primary source
2. Include direct quote if making specific claim
3. Provide page numbers
4. Include DOI or stable URL
5. Note if claim is inference vs. direct statement

## Document Structure

Keep existing structure but:
1. Add [Citation] after every factual claim
2. Include "References" section with full bibliography
3. Add "Evidence" subsections with direct quotes
4. Distinguish between established facts and logical inferences

## Next Steps

1. Search for and download primary sources
2. Read and extract relevant quotes
3. Build bibliography
4. Revise document with proper citations
5. Have each section peer-reviewable

## Status Tracking

- [ ] Phase 1: Core NLP History
- [ ] Phase 2: Sentiment Analysis Emergence  
- [ ] Phase 3: Critical Absence
- [ ] Phase 4: LLM Integration
- [ ] Phase 5: Legal/Ethical
- [ ] Final: Bibliography and citation check

## Notes

- This is multi-session work
- Each phase requires thorough research
- No assertions without citations
- Direct quotes preferred over paraphrasing
- Document what we DON'T find (absence of evidence)
