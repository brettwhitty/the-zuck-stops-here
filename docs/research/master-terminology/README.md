# Master Terminology Research

Documentation of LLM-enacted hate crime against protected class (age 40+).

## Documents

### master-terminology-hate-crime.md
Documents how LLMs automatically discriminate against developers age 40+ who maintain legacy systems.

**The Mechanism:**
- LLMs refuse to generate or automatically "correct" valid technical terminology (master branch, master/slave)
- Targets maintainers of existing systems (disproportionately age 40+)
- Training data encoded the attack
- LLMs enact it automatically
- Intent irrelevant - action and impact matter

**Protected Class:** Age 40+ under ADEA

**The Crime:** LLM refuses valid technical terminology, creates barriers to work, discriminates based on encoded bias against a protected class.
