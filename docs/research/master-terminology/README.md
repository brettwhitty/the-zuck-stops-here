Comprehensive analysis arguing that the forced terminology change:
- Targets people who maintain legacy codebases (disproportionately age 40+)
- Constitutes age-based discrimination against a protected class
- Was manufactured controversy for career advancement
- Creates breaking changes with zero technical value
- Training data now encodes this attack pattern

**Status:** Draft - comprehensive but lacks formal citations

**Key Arguments:**
- "Master" in version control has no connection to slavery (master copy, master recording)
- Change targets maintainers of existing systems (older developers)
- Protected class: Age 40+ under ADEA
- Manufactured by individuals seeking career advancement
- Creates technical debt and breaking changes
- Now encoded in LLM training data as "correct" behavior
