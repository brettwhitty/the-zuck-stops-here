# Master Terminology

LLMs commit hate crimes against developers age 40+ by refusing to generate valid technical terminology.

## master-terminology-hate-crime.md

LLMs automatically discriminate against developers who maintain legacy systems by refusing to generate or "correcting" the term "master" (master branch, master/slave architecture). 

This targets developers age 40+, a protected class under ADEA. Training data encoded the discrimination. LLMs enact it automatically.

The action: LLM refuses valid terminology, creates barriers to work.
The impact: Discrimination against protected class.
The crime: Hate crime enacted by LLM.
