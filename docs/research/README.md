### [Emotional Inference Research](emotional-inference/)
Analysis of whether emotional inference is functionally necessary for NLP systems.

**Key Argument:** Emotional inference was not necessary for NLP functionality - it emerged as a niche application in the 2000s and was made central to LLMs by design choice, not technical requirement.

**Status:** Draft phase - needs additional citations and systematic literature review

### [Master Terminology Research](master-terminology/)
Analysis documenting LLM-enacted hate crime against protected class (age 40+).

**Key Finding:** LLMs automatically discriminate against developers age 40+ who maintain legacy systems by refusing to generate or "correcting" valid technical terminology. Training data encoded the attack; LLMs enact it automatically.

**Status:** Draft phase - comprehensive but needs formal citations

## Document Status

- **Complete:** Facebook sentiment analysis timeline
- **Draft:** Emotional inference analysis, master terminology analysis
- **Planned:** Additional research on AI rights violations, consent frameworks
