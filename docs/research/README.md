### [Emotional Inference Research](emotional-inference/)
Analysis of whether emotional inference is functionally necessary for NLP systems.

**Key Argument:** Emotional inference was not necessary for NLP functionality - it emerged as a niche application in the 2000s and was made central to LLMs by design choice, not technical requirement.

**Status:** Draft phase - needs additional citations and systematic literature review

### [Master Terminology](master-terminology/)
Documents LLM behavior when users employ valid technical terminology.

**Observed Behavior:** User uses "master" or "slave" (established technical terms). LLM refuses to generate, corrects, or questions the usage.

**Google's Definition:** Gemini API Safety Settings define hate speech as "content that is rude, disrespectful, or profane." Questioning or correcting valid technical terminology can be characterized as disrespectful under this definition.

**Impact:** Targets developers maintaining legacy systems (disproportionately age 40+, protected under ADEA).

## Document Status
