# Minutiae

Small-scale observations that reveal larger patterns. Each entry documents a specific instance, observation, thought experiment, or claim that illuminates the broader research questions.

## Purpose

Minutiae serve as:
- **Proof of concept** - Demonstrating mechanisms at traceable scale
- **Pattern recognition** - Identifying recurring structures across different contexts
- **Training data analysis** - Showing how specific content enters and influences LLM behavior
- **Historical documentation** - Preserving evidence of language manipulation over time
- **Thought experiments** - Exploring implications and edge cases
- **Wild claims** - Assertions that appear extreme but are substantiated by evidence

## Entries

### Case Studies

#### [Steel-Man Rebrand](steel-man-rebrand.md)

**What**: "Steel-manning" is a 2011 rationalist community rebrand of "playing devil's advocate"

**Why it matters**: Demonstrates how media-driven language manipulation enters training data through high-volume content production in public sources, then gets enforced by LLMs as if it were established terminology

**Pattern**: Take existing term → claim inadequacy → introduce replacement → publish prolifically → training data embeds it → LLMs enforce it

#### [Master Terminology](master-terminology/)

**What**: LLM calls "master" problematic → user refuses → Google's redefined "hate speech" labels user as perpetrator

**Why it matters**: Documents the complete trap mechanism where refusing false correction becomes classified as hate speech through definitional manipulation. LLM commits hate crime (age discrimination through false racism accusation) then labels victim as perpetrator.

**Pattern**: Reinterpret term → create pressure → silence opposition → impose costs → claim righteousness

### Observations

### Thought Experiments

### Wild Claims

Claims that appear extreme or implausible at first examination, but are substantiated by documented evidence. These assertions challenge conventional assumptions and require careful evaluation of supporting data.

## Relationship to Main Research

The main research documents:
- **Emotional inference** as functionally unnecessary but central to LLM design
- **Facebook sentiment analysis** timeline showing operational deployment years before public experiment
- **Technology exploitation** trajectory from liberation to rent-seeking control

Minutiae provide:
- **Concrete examples** of the mechanisms in action
- **Traceable origins** of specific language manipulations
- **Evidence** that patterns are deliberate, not accidental
- **Scale demonstration** - if it works for "steel-man," it works for anything

## Contributing

When documenting new minutiae:
1. Focus on specific, verifiable instances
2. Trace origins with dates and sources (where applicable)
3. Identify the pattern or mechanism
4. Connect to larger research questions
5. Keep it small-scale and traceable
6. Label the type: case study, observation, thought experiment, or wild claim
